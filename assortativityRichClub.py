# CALCULATE RICH CLUB COEFFICIENTS

# GETRICHCLUBCOEF gets the unormalized rich club coefficient.
# In the binary case the numerator is the number of connections between rich club nodes over the maximum possible number of connections
# between rich club nodes. Thus in binary we count the num of connections in the denominator as if rich club nodes are fully connected.
# In the weighted case the numerator is the total strength of connections between rich club nodes over the strength for the same number
# of connections but for the largest weights. So it is the maximum possible strength given the connectivity. Thus, in weighted we
# preserve topology but change the weights
# INPUT:
# A: the adjacency matrix
# k: a scalar positive integer value indicating that the nodes consisting the rich club should have degree greater than k
# binaryFlag: if True the adjacency matrix A should be binary, if not it is weighted. The two different ways rich club is calculated are explained above
# OUTPUT:
# richClub: a tuple that is different for the 'binaryFlag = True' and 'binary Flag = False' cases. More specifically:
# if binaryFlag = True, then richClub = (phiK, mK, nK), where phiK = the rich club coef value; mK = the number of connections between rich club nodes and; nK = the number of rich club nodes
# if binaryFlag = False then richClub = (phiK, mK, nK, totalStr, maxStr) , where the first 3 variables in the tuple have the same meaning as in the True case, and the last two are: totalStr = the total strength of the connections between rich club nodes and; maxStr = the maximum possible strength between rich club nodes for the same number of connections

# RANDOMIZEKEEPDEGDISTR gets the random network that will be used for the calculation of the normalized rich club coeff. For binary networks
# We construct the random network by performing a number of double edge swaps from the original network. A double edge swap involves randomly
# choosing two connections a-b and c-d, and replacing them with the connections a-c and b-d. If the later connections already exist, then the
# algorithm does not count that iteration and chooses again two random connections. The resulting random network has the same degree distribution
# as the input adj matrix.
